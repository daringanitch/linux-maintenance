# Monthly Maintenance Routine for 10 Ubuntu Servers

Here's a suggested monthly maintenance routine for 10 Ubuntu servers:

1. **Patch Management:** Apply security updates to Ubuntu OS and other installed software packages. You can use the 'apt-get' command to update the system packages.
2. **Check Disk Space:** Monitor the disk space usage of each server and ensure that it has sufficient space available. You can use the 'df' command to check the disk space.
3. **Clean Temporary Files:** Remove temporary files, caches, and log files that are no longer required. You can use the 'find' command to locate and delete these files.
4. **Check System Logs:** Check the system logs for any unusual events, errors or warnings. This can help identify potential issues before they become critical. You can use the 'grep' command to search through log files.
5. **Check CPU/Memory Usage:** Monitor the CPU and memory usage of each server to ensure that they are not being overutilized. You can use the 'top' command to check the system resources.
6. **Test Backups:** Verify that the server backups are working correctly and that data can be restored if necessary. This can help ensure business continuity in case of any disaster.
7. **Firewall Configuration:** Review the firewall configuration to ensure that it's still appropriate and sufficient to protect the server from unwanted network traffic. You can use the 'ufw' command to configure the Ubuntu firewall.
8. **Review User Access:** Review the user accounts and access levels on each server to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and applications. You can use the 'sudo' command to manage user accounts.
9. **Monitor System Services:** Monitor the running services on each server to ensure that they are working correctly. You can use the 'systemctl' command to manage the system services.
10. **Reboot the Servers:** Reboot each server to ensure that all changes are properly applied and to refresh the system. You can use the 'reboot' command to reboot the server.

By following this monthly maintenance routine, you can help ensure that the Ubuntu servers are running smoothly and securely. You may need to modify the routine based on your specific requirements and environment.
